# Lab 4 — Arithmetic Coding & JPEG (from scratch)

This lab implements two classic image–compression pipelines:

1. **Arithmetic Coding** on grayscale images (PGM P5), including a tiny PGM reader/writer and bit–level I/O.
2. **JPEG compression** (simplified) built from the core steps: RGB→YCbCr, 8×8 DCT, quantization, dequantization, IDCT, and reconstruction.

> All code is educational and avoids using external compression libraries, so you can see the mechanics.
