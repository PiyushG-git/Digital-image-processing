# Lab 5 — Edge Detection using Convolution (Laplacian Filter)

This lab demonstrates **edge detection** in digital images using a **manually implemented 2D convolution** with the **Laplacian operator**.  
The goal is to highlight regions of rapid intensity change (edges) without using any built-in OpenCV filters.
